# PWFA-eTracks

This code was developed to simulate electrons injected into the wake of an electron-driven plasma wakefield accelerator. The master script simulates the path of electrons givin initial radial position and momentum, and generates the electron path within the accelerator bubble.

The goal of this project is to determine the boundary conditions for electron capture within the wake, in hopes of creating beams with designer profiles in the future.
